# Honeybucket

Honeybucket is your personal AI assistant project built on OpenClaw.

This repository starts as a planning and execution workspace for the first 30 days (from February 22, 2026 to March 22, 2026).

## Project docs

- `docs/technical-setup.md`: technical setup runbook for OpenClaw
- `docs/month-1-roadmap.md`: week-by-week build plan with effort estimates
- `docs/month-1-deliverables.csv`: importable tracker (Notion/Sheets/Jira)

## Suggested execution cadence

- Sunday planning: pick weekly goals and lock scope
- Daily async check-in: update `status` in `docs/month-1-deliverables.csv`
- Friday validation: demo outcomes vs acceptance criteria
- Sunday retro: adjust estimates for next week

## Success target for month 1

By March 22, 2026, Honeybucket should:

1. Run reliably as an OpenClaw gateway service.
2. Handle one primary messaging channel end-to-end.
3. Use safe pairing and approval controls.
4. Complete at least 10 real user tasks with >80% success.
